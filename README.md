Module 4 Work

The main takeaway from our analysis is that at least on the surface Charter schools seem to be able to outcompete Public schools in most ways.  The results showing the average test scores per school type are displayed below and they show that Charter schools beat Public schools in both areas with a fairly decent gap in the math scores in particular.

    Charter	72.450603	66.761883
    Public	72.281219	62.951576

This gap in test scores is made even more interesting when notice that the difference in budget where Charter schools appear to have a smaller budget overall.

    Charter	872625.66
    Public	911195.56

These two points of data in particular would indicate that Charter schools have the edge when it comes to education, however I don't believe this to be the entire picture and to get a better picture it would require not only additional analysis but also more data.  For example either a breakdown of how a schools budget is spent or perhaps the average family income of students at each school might provide additional context.  Perhaps Public schools spend a significant portion of their budget on things like providing after school programs for children of working parents or providing free meals for low income families.  Other information that might be interesting to look at would be the average income of the teachers at each school as well as the number of teachers per student.  In my mind both could be linked with student success or in other words be a puzzle piece of student success.
